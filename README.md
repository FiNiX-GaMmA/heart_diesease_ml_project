# ML Heart Disease Prediction

This project is about predicting the presence of heart disease in a patient based on various medical factors. We will be using machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 303 instances with 76 attributes, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, and various other features. The target variable is the presence of heart disease, which is binary (1 for presence, 0 for absence).

## Tools Used

- Python programming language
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn library for machine learning algorithms
- Pandas library for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for data visualization

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used

We will be using the following machine learning algorithms to create our predictive model:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

## Results

After training and evaluating our models, we found that the Random Forest algorithm gave the best performance with an accuracy score of 87%. This indicates that our model can predict the presence of heart disease with high accuracy based on the given medical factors.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting the presence of heart disease in a patient based on various medical factors. Our model can be used to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart disease and providing appropriate treatment.
